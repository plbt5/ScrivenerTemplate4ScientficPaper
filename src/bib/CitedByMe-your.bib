abstract = {IEEE Standard 1471 identifies sound practices to establish a framework and vocabulary for software architecture concepts.In 2000, theComputer Society approved IEEE Standard 1471, which documents a consensus on good architectural description practices. Five core concepts and relationships provide the foundation for the approved IEEE1471 version: every system has an architecture, but an architecture is not a system; an architecture and an architecture description are not the same thing; architecture standards, descriptions, and development processes can differ and be developed separately; architecture descriptions are inherently multiviewed; and separating the concept of an object's view from its specification is an effective way to write architecture description standards. IEEE 1471 focuses on both software intensive systems and more general systems, such as information systems, embedded systems, systems-of-systems, product lines, and product families in which software plays a substantial role in development, operation, or evolution},

abstract = {In this thesis, I propose a method of constructing semantic reference systems for geographic information based on reproducible observations. Similar to spatial reference systems, semantic reference systems consist of formal theories ( refer- ence theories ) with conventionally established interpretations into perceptual and constructive operations (such as pointing to a physical monument, and describing locations relative to it). They can be used to annotate data and describe and compare their semantics. The thesis addresses the grounding part of reference syste ms. I argue that persisting problems of information ontologies, namely the grounding problem and the problem of reference , could be solved using certain principles of construction and imitation in terms of perceptual operations. These operations focus joint human attention on pre-conceptual cognit ive mechanisms, i.e. 'Gestalts', in the perceived space around the body. They also allow an observer to relate foci of attention based on the Gestalt. The memorized relations are expressed by observation predicates, to be established by convention in terms of speech acts of an observation language. These speech acts can be shared, and thus represent lowest level information items. I propo se a kind of “practical constructivism” guided by a formal language. The idea is to describe data categories in terms of observation predicates, i.e. “bottom-up” , in order to reconstruct the underlying observation procedure, instead of presuming abstract concepts. For example, bodies, surfaces, and different kinds of media in the human environment are grounded in terms of pe rceived affordances. Object properties such as waterdepth are grounded in exper iential geometry, visual surfaces and media of diving. I propose a correspo nding reference theory and put it to a practical test in this thesis: I define an essential road network category, namely a junction, and test the definition in Open Street Map.},

@inproceedings{Cregan2007,
abstract = {A true semantic web of data requires dynairtic, real-time interoperability between disparate data sources, developed by different organizations in different ways, each for their own specific purposes. Ontology languages provide a means to relate data items to each other in logically well-defined ways, producing complex logical structures with an underlying formal semantics. Whilst these structures have a logical formal semantics, they lack a pragmatic semantics linking them in a systematic and unambiguous way to the real world entities they represent. Thus they are intricate ``castles in the air{\{}''{\}}, which may certainly have pathways built to link them together, but lack the solid foundations required for robust real-time dynamic interoperability between structures not mapped to each other in the design stage. Current ontology interoperability strategies lack such a meaning-based arbitrator, and depend instead on human mediation or heuristic approaches. This paper introduces the symbol grounding problem, explains its relevance for the Semantic Web, illustrates how inappropriate correspondence between symbol and referent can result in logically valid but meaningless inferences, examines some of the shortcomings of the current approach in dealing effectively at the level of meaning, and concludes with some ideas for identifying effective grounding strategies.},

@article{Zachman1987,
abstract = {With increasing size and complexity of the implementa-tions of information systems, it is necessary to use some logical construct (or architecture) for defining and controlling the interfaces and the integration of all of the components of the system. This paper defines information systems architecture by creating a d e scriptive framework from disciplines quite independent of information systems, then by analogy specifies in-formation systems architecture based upon the neu-tral, objective framework. Also, some preliminary conclusions about the implications of the resultant descriptive framework are drawn. The discussion is limited to architecture and does not include a strategic planning methodology. T he subject of information systems architecture is beginning to receive considerable attention. The increased scope of design and levels of complex-ity of information systems implementations are forc-ing the use of some logical construct (or architecture) for defining and controlling the interfaces and the integration of all of the components of the system. Thirty years ago this issue was not at all significant because the technology itself did not provide for either breadth in scope or depth in complexity in information systems. The inherent limitations of the then-available 4K machines, for example, con-strained design and necessitated suboptimal ap-proaches for automating a business. Current technology is rapidly removing both concep-tual and financial constraints. It is not hard to spec-ulate about, if not realize, very large, very complex systems implementations, extending in scope and complexity to encompass an entire enterprise. One can readily delineate the merits of the large, complex, enterprise-oriented approaches. Such systems allow flexibility in managing business changes and coher-ency in the management of business resources. How-ever, there also is merit in the more traditional, smaller, suboptimal systems design approach. Such systems are relatively economical, quickly imple-mented, and easier to design and manage. In either case, since the technology permits " distrib-uting " large amounts of computing facilities in small packages to remote locations, some kind of structure (or architecture) is imperative because decentraliza-tion without structure is chaos. Therefore, to keep the business from disintegrating, the concept of in-formation systems architecture is becoming less an option and more a necessity for establishing some order and control in the investment of information systems resources. The cost involved and the success of the business depending increasingly on its infor-mation systems require a disciplined approach to the management of those systems.},

abstract = {Ontologies are being applied very successfully in supporting information and knowledge exchange between people and organisations. However, for many reasons, different people and organisations will tend to use different ontologies. Therefore, in order to exchange information and knowledge, either everyone must adopt the same ontology — an unlikely scenario — or it must be possible to reconcile different ontologies. This chapter examines the issues and techniques in the reconciliation of ontologies. First, it examines the reasons why people and organisations will tend to use different ontologies, and why the pervasive adoption of common ontologies is unlikely. It then reviews alternative architectures for multipleontology systems on a large scale. A comparative analysis is provided of a number of frameworks which analyse types of mismatches between ontologies. The process of ontology reconciliation is outlined. Finally, some existing software tools that support reconciliation are surveyed, and areas are identified where further work is necessary.},

abstract = {The Organisations may use heterogeneous ontologies for the same domain which results in the representation of different concepts to the same concept. The interoperability problem arises when two ontologies are trying to commune with each other and hence the ontology mapping is required. The ontology mapping discovers the relationship between the pair of concepts of heterogeneous ontology and depicts whether the concepts are similar or not. The mapping document will be generated on mapping two ontologies. The ontologies must respond to the change requirements which make the mapping document to be inconsistent. This paper reports various mapping tools for mapping two ontologies and depicts various techniques such as mapping composition, mapping adaptation and floating model. It also describes various mapping approaches such as KOAN approach, WISE approach and SKIS approach for making the mapping document to be consistent. The existing mapping techniques and approaches deals with the mapping document consistency. The requirement for reconciliation mapping approach is proposed which uses various scenarios for consistency maintenance. In addition to consistency maintenance, it also provides time efficiency, space efficiency and accuracy.},
