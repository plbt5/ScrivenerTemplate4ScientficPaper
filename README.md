# ScrivenerTemplate4ScientificPaper
My template for a Scrivener project that shows the stucture and some hints for producing an excellent scientific paper. The organisation of files and directories is conforming the demands of my `doPandoc` scripts, available from https://github.com/plbt5/doPandoc.git

Use the `createPaper.bat` script to create a duplicate and adapt its basic elements in support of your new paper. 

Latex templates are available in the \templates directory. The mystyle2015.sty can be placed in your local MiKTeX configuration directory as: C:\Users\<user>\texmf\tex\latex\local
